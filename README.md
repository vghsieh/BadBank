# Bad Bank App

## Description

This is the MIT xPRO capstone Bad Bank app, with the frontend bootstrapped with Create React App, and the backend using Google Firebase. 

For the backend:
The authentication used Firebase's email and password authentication.
The database that is pulled into this app is from the Firebase Realtime Database.
This project is also deployed and hosted on Firebase.

## Utilization

The Bad Bank app can be found [here](https://bad-bank-c9466.web.app/).

The Navbar has links to create an account, login, deposit and withdrawals, all data (making it a bad bank), and logout tabs.

## Roadmap

Future ideas include:

- Hiding tabs when the user is not logged in
- Showing the name of the user when the user is logged in
- Clearing the page when the user has logged in
- Having navigation to the login page after an account is successfully created
